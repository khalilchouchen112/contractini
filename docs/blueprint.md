## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3B82F6) to inspire trust and reliability in managing important contract information.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB) for a clean and professional look that minimizes distractions.
- Accent color: Light Blue (#60A5FA) used for interactive elements, drawing attention without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, chosen for its modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use simple, geometric icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Design Icons to represent contract types, actions, and status indicators. Favor a filled-in style for legibility.
- Implement a responsive design with clear, card-based layouts for contract summaries, and modal windows for detailed views and actions. Ensure readability and ease of navigation across all devices.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for a polished user experience, such as fade-in effects for content loading, and smooth transitions between views. Avoid excessive animations that may distract from the app's core functionality.
